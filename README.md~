# Cricket-Project
A project to learn and understand more about python, with a friend of mine.
So this is pretty much the first project we will start with, and probably there are many more to follow.
We intend to develop a sound knowledge of certain imp. modules like re and urllib through this project.
The names of the two people contributing are:
Vaibhav Gupta(me) and Rishabh Gaur.

We also intend to learn basics of working with git and thus plan to use github for the small duration of this project.
